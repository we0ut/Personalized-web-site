              <p class="education-text">
                Playing guitar has been one of the biggest passions in my life
                for the past seven years. I own two guitars—a Jackson JS32 and
                an Ibanez 7-string—that I use to explore a wide range of tones
                and styles, especially within the heavier and more progressive
                genres. I love both writing my own riffs and compositions, as
                well as learning songs from bands that have inspired me over the
                years. Some of my biggest influences include Periphery, Bring Me
                the Horizon, Trivium, Spiritbox, and Loathe—bands whose music
                has had a huge impact on my playing style and creativity.
              </p>

              <p class="education-text">
                I've had the incredible opportunity to see all of them live,
                which only deepened my appreciation for their musicianship and
                stage presence. Watching them perform gave me even more
                motivation to continue improving and expressing myself through
                music. Whether I'm jamming, experimenting with new ideas, or
                working on technique, the guitar is my go-to outlet and a key
                part of who I am.

                My Passion for Traveling the World
              </h2>

              <p class="education-text">
                Traveling is one of my greatest passions, and I truly hope that
                one day I'll have the chance to explore every corner of the
                world. There's something incredibly exciting and fulfilling
                about stepping into a new place—hearing a different language,
                trying unfamiliar food, and getting immersed in a culture
                completely different from your own. I've been lucky enough to
                visit a wide range of incredible cities, including Vienna,
                Barcelona, Bern, Stockholm, and Berlin, each offering its own
                unique charm, history, and atmosphere.
              </p>

              <p class="education-text">
                I've also explored much of the Balkans, which has helped me
                understand and appreciate the diversity and richness of the
                region I come from. Whether I'm walking through historic
                streets, admiring architecture, or simply meeting new people,
                every trip has left me with unforgettable experiences and
                valuable life lessons. Traveling has opened my mind, inspired my
                creativity, and deepened my appreciation for the world's beauty
                and complexity. It's a journey that never truly ends, and I hope
                to continue discovering new places, cultures, and perspectives
                for the rest of my life.

                Why Video Games Will Always Be a Part of Me
              </h2>

              <p class="education-text">
                Video games have been a huge part of my life for as long as I
                can remember, and my love for them has only grown stronger over
                the years. The first game I clearly remember playing was Need
                for Speed: Underground 2, and since then, I've been hooked on
                the excitement, creativity, and immersive experiences that
                gaming offers. What fascinates me most about video games is the
                ability to dive into rich, imaginative worlds and be a part of
                incredible stories—whether it's saving a futuristic city,
                fighting off enemies in epic battles, or simply exploring a vast
                open world full of mystery and wonder.
              </p>
              <p class="education-text">
                I enjoy playing all kinds of genres, including open-world
                adventures, action-packed shooters, hack and slash games, and
                story-driven titles. Some of my all-time favorites include the
                Metal Gear Solid franchise, Devil May Cry 5, Horizon Zero Dawn,
                and many others. These games have not only entertained me but
                also inspired me with their storytelling, characters, and
                gameplay mechanics. For me, gaming is more than just a
                hobby—it's a form of art and a way to experience emotions,
                challenges, and narratives in a deeply interactive way.
