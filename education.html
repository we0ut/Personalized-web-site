                During my time at DSU RCSOO "Nikola Karev" in Strumica, I gained
                a strong foundation in various areas of computer science and
                electrical engineering. The curriculum was diverse and hands-on,
                covering key subjects such as electrotechnics, programming in
                C++, web design, and computer networks and security.
              </p>

              <p class="education-text">
                These courses not only equipped me with practical skills but
                also deepened my understanding of how software and hardware
                systems work together. The experience was both challenging and
                rewarding, and it played a crucial role in shaping my technical
                knowledge and preparing me for future academic and professional
                pursuits in the IT field.

                I've just completed my first year of Computer Science at FINKI
                in Skopje, and it has been an enriching and challenging journey.
                Throughout the year, I studied core subjects such as
                Object-Oriented Programming, Calculus 1 and 2, Discrete
                Mathematics 1 and 2, Fundamentals of Web Design, and Computer
                Architecture and Organization.

              <p class="education-text">
                These courses provided a solid theoretical and practical
                foundation in both software development and the underlying
                principles of computer systems. I developed strong
                problem-solving and programming skills, especially through
                hands-on coding assignments and projects. This first year has
                not only deepened my interest in computer science but also
                prepared me for more advanced topics in the years ahead.

                I have had the opportunity to participate in two Erasmus+
                projects that greatly enriched my personal and professional
                development. The first project, InnoTheater, took place in
                Barcelona, Spain, and focused on using innovative theater
                methods to foster creativity, collaboration, and self-expression
                among young people. It was a unique and engaging experience that
                allowed me to develop my communication and teamwork skills in a
                multicultural environment.
              </p>
              <p class="education-text">
                The second project was held in Stockholm, Sweden, and was
                centered around renewable energy and sustainability. Through
                workshops, discussions, and hands-on activities, I gained deeper
                insight into green technologies and the importance of
                sustainable practices in today's world. Both projects were
                unforgettable and helped me grow as a globally minded and
                socially responsible individual.
